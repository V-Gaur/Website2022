I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems.

I completed my PhD in July 2021 under the supervision of Dr. Corey Lang at the University of Rhode Island in the Environmental and Natural Resource Economics department.

I am an applied economist, with a strong background and research interests in Environmental Economics, particularly policy relevant analysis and non-market valuation using both revealed and stated preference methods, and causal inference techniques.
